# GOFLOW: Geostationary Ocean Flow

Deep learning framework for predicting ocean surface velocity fields from satellite sea surface temperature (SST) gradient observations.
![GOFLOW testing and training framework](FIG01.png)
## Overview

GOFLOW trains neural networks to infer ocean flow dynamics (U, V velocity components) from thermal gradient patterns observed in satellite imagery. The approach leverages the physical relationship between SST gradients and surface currents to enable velocity estimation from widely available satellite observations.

**IGW filtering note: GOFLOW predicts velocities with internal gravity wave
(IGW) variability removed. The LLC training velocities are filtered with an
18-hour window to eliminate IGWs, while SST gradients are used as input because
SST is not strongly affected by IGWs.**

**Key Features:**
- Multiple neural network architectures (UNet, ConvNeXt-style, lightweight CNN)
- Hybrid loss functions combining L1, spectral, and gradient-based losses
- Two-stage training workflow for improved spectral characteristics
- Inference pipeline for GOES satellite brightness temperature data

## Quick Start

### Training Data

The small LLC-subset training file used by the paper-scale examples is
`llcGoes_gradT_trunc.nc`. Download it from Google Drive (around 125 GB):

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fbwdcDnkHZ6UJMr4QM_qP2AFX9faAzeC/view?usp=sharing

Place the file in the repository root, or pass its location with `--llc_file`.
### GOES satellite inference Data
The GOES datasets which have been used to generate the figures in the paper and for validation and testing are provided below.
- the dataset that corresponds to the NESMA experiment used for validating GOFLOW
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i7Ml9LxQEA0hMmVASdIwan8dv3y1tV_l/view?usp=drive_link
- the dataset that has a clean cloud free period of data and was used to generate Figure 1
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/15WUoI8p8r2pgb69QdU3g4ydUR0m8Q9Wb/view?usp=drive_link
Both these datasets have been preprocessed to add log[grad T] inputs and can be directly used with the inference scripts.

### Training

```bash
# Basic UNet training (Stage 0: L1 loss only)
python train_goflow.py --cuda 0 --model unet --nbase 16 --c_spec 0.0 --epochs 100

# Stage 1: Fine-tune with spectral loss
python train_goflow.py --cuda 0 --model unet --nbase 16 --c_spec 0.5 --epochs 50

# Use gradient loss (vorticity/strain) instead of spectral loss
python train_goflow.py --cuda 0 --model unet --c_spec 0.5 --use_grad_loss
```

### Inference

```bash
# Run inference on GOES satellite data
python inf_llc_stage1.py --model_file lgt_unet16_1_3_0.5cs.pth --goes_files satellite_data.nc

# With input normalization (if model was trained with it)
python inf_llc_stage1.py --model_file model.pth --inp_norm --goes_files data.nc
```

    ↓
Neural Network (UNet / SamudraUNet / TwoLayerCNN)
    ↓

### Model Architectures

|-------|-------------|----------|
| `unet` | Classical U-Net encoder-decoder with skip connections | Default, best accuracy |

| `samudraR` | ConvNeXt-based U-Net with reflect padding | Reduced edge artifacts |

### Loss Functions

The training uses a configurable hybrid loss:

```
Loss = (1 - c_spec) × L1_loss + c_spec × auxiliary_loss
```

Where `auxiliary_loss` is either:
- **Spectral Loss**: MSE in log-space of 2D FFT kinetic energy spectrum
- **Gradient Loss**: Vorticity and strain magnitude constraints

## Data Format

### Training Data (LLC)

NetCDF file with variables:
- `loggrad_T`: Log SST gradient field `[time, y, x]`
- `U`: Zonal velocity `[time, y, x]`
- `V`: Meridional velocity `[time, y, x]`

### Satellite Data (GOES)

NetCDF file with:
- `BT_gradient`: Brightness temperature gradient `[time, y, x]`

### Normalization

- SST gradient (`loggrad_T`): Range [-19, 0] normalized to [0, 1]
- SST: Range [0, 30°C] normalized to [0, 1]

## Two-Stage Training Workflow

For best results, we recommend a two-stage training approach:

1. **Stage 0**: Train with pure L1 loss (`c_spec=0.0`) for ~100 epochs
   - Learns basic velocity patterns
   - Fast convergence

2. **Stage 1**: Fine-tune with spectral loss (`c_spec=0.2`) for ~50 epochs
   - Improves spectral characteristics
   - Better small-scale structure

```bash
# Stage 0
python train_goflow.py --cuda 0 --model unet --nbase 16 --c_spec 0.0 --epochs 100

# Stage 1 (loads best model from Stage 0)
python train_goflow.py --cuda 0 --model unet --nbase 16 --c_spec 0.2 --epochs 50
```

## Model Checkpoints

Models are saved with the naming convention:
```
lgt_<model><nbase>_<step0>_<nframes>_<c_spec>cs.pth
```

Example: `lgt_unet16_1_3_0.5cs.pth`

## Reproduction Metrics

Training now writes compact metric artifacts in addition to the legacy
`r2_*.npy` file:

- `metrics_<model>_ver_<c_spec>cs.json`: configuration, per-epoch histories,
  and selected-checkpoint metrics
- `metrics_<model>_ver_<c_spec>cs.npz`: NumPy form of the same histories and
  summary values

The JSON summary tracks selected gradient R2, velocity R2, spectral loss, and
the best velocity/spectral epochs. These additions do not change the model,
losses, optimizer, or default training split.

## Spatial Transferability limitation

A limitation of the current goflow paradigm is that transferability of trained models to far off target regions is still lacking.
A key reason is related to input normalization, which remains difficult to address because there is no climatology of log[grad T],
our input variable. This can be alleviated by normalizing the input log[grad T] at each spatial point with the mean and variance across time
(this is an year for the LLC4320 solution). However this is still being tested. For adjacent regions, inpBN=True (a default which enables input Batch Normalization)
works very well.

The figure below is an example stage-1 fold map from a larger LLC-domain demo.
It shows held-out fold locations (i.e. one of the 5 regions is test and the other are for training) with the selected-checkpoint velocity and
gradient R2 values. It is included here to illustrate limitations of the existing
GOFLOW approach under spatial transfer, not to introduce a new method. In the plot
g referes to gradient (an average of the vorticity R2 and strain magnitude R2) and v to velocity R2. Note the wide variability of the 
gradient accuracy from a 0.5 to as low as 0.19.
![Stage 1 spatial transferability demo](docs/figures/spatial_transfer_stage1.png)

This option is is already present in the existing repo but the larger LLC domain data is currently not provided due to its size, but will be included 
as part of upcoming work.
